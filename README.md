## FlowerDataRecognition
#### Libraries used: keras, skimage, os, glob, numpy, matplotlib, random, resnet, numpy, 

Flower classification: First, we will see how to classify flowers them into “roses” and “daisies”. This is a toy dataset and its purpose is to introduce you to the key concepts and methodologies. In this session, you will learn:

How to set-up an end-to-end pipeline for training deep learning models

Preprocessing techniques: Morphological transformations etc.

Data augmentation using data generators

Building a network: Ablation experiments, hyperparameter tuning, storing the best model in disk etc.
